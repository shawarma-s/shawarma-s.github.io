        <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Conflict with our siblings. It's unavoidable for 82% of people. Arguments with a twin on the other hand is something only 3.2% of us will experience. Running a London mob with your twin brother is even less likely. Even rarer still is your twin brother being a paranoid schizophrenic who attacks and sabotages you multiple times, sending you to jail and destroying your relationships and ‘business’. For gangster Reggie Kray however, this is his everyday life. Well, him and his brother Ron (who may have a couple screws loose).</span>‎<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> may be based off the book </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Profession of Violence&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">by&nbsp;John Pearson, it has a surprising amount of similarities to Shakespeare's </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Despite the 400 year gap between the texts, both continue to captivate audiences with their key themes of family, betrayal and mental illness.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet </span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend </span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">explore complexities in familial relationships and the conflicts which come with them. In Hamlet, the eponymous protagonist grapples with his duty towards his father's memory and his loyalties to his mother. The tension between Hamlet's desire for justice and his internal struggle with filial duty presents a dilemma that resonates with audiences across time. Similarly, </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> portrays the dynamic between the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, who share an unbreakable bond as brothers while simultaneously wrestling with their own ambitions and desires. The movie explores the conflict caused within Reggie and Rons connection as twins, as well the impact of their lifestyle on their loved one's.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend,</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Reggie falls in love with his driver's sister, Frances. He promises to abandon his life of crime in the hopes of marrying her one day. His brother Ron on the other hand isn’t too fond of this idea. Ron's mental illness, paranoid schizophrenia, adds a layer of complexity to their relationship. His unpredictable behavior and hallucinations become catalysts for conflict and betrayal within the narrative, mirroring the themes explored in Hamlet. The audience is compelled to witness the internal struggles faced by both Reggie and Hamlet as they navigate the treacherous terrain of family loyalty and personal desires. These complex relationships lead to conflict and betrayal in both texts.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Betrayal is another theme that intertwines the narratives of </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. In Hamlet, the ultimate act of betrayal is committed by Claudius, who not only murders his own brother but also marries Queen Gertrude. This betrayal sets off a chain of events that shapes the trajectory of the play. Similarly, in Legend, betrayal is a constant presence as external threats and internal conflicts erode the trust between the Kray brothers. The struggle for power, the lure of wealth, and the pursuit of individual desires lead to the fracturing of their once-unbreakable bond. The consequences of betrayal and the weight it carries are depicted in both works, evoking a sense of tragedy and raising profound questions about trust, loyalty, and the cost of personal ambition. Reggie succumbing to the lure of money puts strain on his relationship with Fances. With all the people in her life falling for the lure of crime, Frances is left alone and neglected. A character parallel can be seen with Ophelia in </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Both characters are neglected by their lover and brother, which leads to mental struggles like depression.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not only are both Ophelia and Frances lead female characters in each of their texts, but they’re both neglected and pushed to the side by the male leads in the stories. For Ophelia, this leads to her mental state becoming unstable. With her father dead and her brother in a fit blind rage, Ophelia quite simply has no one. On top of this, Hamlet, in an attempt to retain his disguise of madness, claimed that he didn’t love her - “I / loved you not.” (3.1.118-119). A similar scenario can be seen in </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Frances’ mother doesn’t approve of her being with Reggie at </span><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">all</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, since he is a criminal. This leads to her cutting all ties with her daughter. Her brother is busy working for Reggie, and Reggie himself is busy taking care of himself, his business, and most importantly his brother. Without Reggie, Ron doesn’t take his meds, leading to his condition worsening and him becoming more unstable, hence why Ron takes up so much of Reggies time. With all these things going on, Reggie practically forgets that Frances needs his attention and love too. With no one to care for her, Frances falls into depression and develops an addiction to many pills and antidepressants.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tt0Bj6KqLSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Similarly, the neglect of Ophelia in </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> leads to her mysterious death, “Her death was doubtful” (5.1 221). Context clues in the play suggest that her death was a suicide or in relation to mental health issues.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mental illness, a prominent theme in both Hamlet and Legend, adds another layer of complexity to the narratives. In </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the titular character's descent into madness is a subject of debate and interpretation, raising questions about the impact of grief, guilt, and obsession on one's sanity. Similarly, Ron Kray's paranoid schizophrenia in </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend </span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">brings forth the challenges faced by individuals struggling with mental health issues. In the beginning of the movie, Rons Doctor says to Reggie, “Your brother, Ron, is violent and psychopathic and I suspect he's paranoid schizophrenic. To put it simply he's off his f***ing rocker!”.&nbsp;</span><br><br><img src="assets/img/Screenshot%202023-06-19%20011649.png" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;display: flex;width: 50vw;/*border-radius: 25px;*/margin-top: 4vh;"><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ron's unpredictable behavior, fueled by his illness, becomes a catalyst for conflict and self-destruction, ultimately affecting the lives of those around him. Both works shed light on the fragile nature of mental stability and the impact it can have on personal relationships and individual identity.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The timeless themes of family, betrayal, and mental illness intertwine in Shakespeare's </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamlet </span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and the </span><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Legend</span></em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Both texts delve into the complexities of familial relationships, the consequences of betrayal, and the impact of mental instability on individuals and their loved ones. From Hamlet's internal struggle with loyalty and justice to Reggie's conflict with his twin brother Ron, the exploration of these themes resonates across time, revealing the universal nature of human struggles within families. These works offer poignant insights into the fragility of trust, the cost of personal ambition, and the profound effects of neglect and mental instability on both individuals and their relationships.</span></p>
